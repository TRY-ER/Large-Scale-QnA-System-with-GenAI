# Large-Scale-QnA-System-with-GenAI

Large Scale Question Answering System" a full-stack platform designed to address various inquiries. At its core lies a pre-trained LLM (Gemini - Pro). By harnessing this knowledge through strategic prompt engineering and context management, the system delivers informative and user-friendly responses in real-time. To ensure the information flows seamlessly, backend generators and frontend Server-Sent Events (SSE) work in tandem, minimizing user latency. Furthermore, the system transforms raw LLM output into visually appealing and well-structured responses through the implementation of HTML parsing on the frontend. ReactJS is employed for the user interface, facilitating intuitive navigation and effortless interaction with the platform.
